# Metacrafters ETH + AVAX PROOF: Intermediate EVM Course - Error Handling using Crowdfunded Lottery Application
A decentralized application that allows users to participate in a crowdfunded lottery.

## Description

* The Crowdfunded Lottery smart contract is designed to enable users to buy tickets and participate in a lottery. The lottery runs for a set duration, after which a winner is randomly selected to receive the entire prize pool. This contract is deployed on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and fairness in the game process.
* This also demonstrates how `assert`, `require` and `revert` works.

## Getting Started

### Installing

* To interact with this smart contract, you will need an Ethereum wallet like MetaMask that can interact with the Ethereum network.
* Ensure that you have enough ETH in your wallet to participate in the lottery and pay for gas fees.

### Executing program

* Connect your Ethereum wallet to a web interface that interacts with the smart contract.
* To participate in the lottery: Call the buyTicket function with the exact amount of ETH as specified by the `ticketPrice`.
* To check the lottery status and results, you can monitor the emitted events or interact with the contract's public variables using a blockchain explorer.
* You can work on this using a compiler like [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
